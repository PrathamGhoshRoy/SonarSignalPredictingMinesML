# SonarSignalPredictingMinesML
A Machine Learning project which makes use of Logistic Regression to predict multi-variate sonar scan inputs as either a rock or a mine.

Machine Learning Project - Sonar Signal Predicting Sea Mines
Making prediction models for sonar data to predict the presence of sea mines is important for several reasons:

1. Safety and Security: Sea mines pose a significant threat to naval vessels, submarines, and even commercial ships. Predictive models help identify and locate potential mines, thereby reducing the risk to human lives and maritime assets.

2. Cost-Efficiency: Detecting sea mines manually is a time-consuming and expensive process. Predictive models allow for automated and continuous monitoring of underwater regions, making mine detection more cost-effective.

3. Early Warning: Predictive models can provide early warnings of potential mine threats. By analyzing historical sonar data and identifying patterns associated with mine presence, these models can alert naval or coastguard authorities in advance, allowing them to take appropriate action.

4. Resource Allocation: By accurately predicting where mines are likely to be located, resources can be allocated more efficiently. This ensures that anti-mine efforts, such as deploying mine-sweeping ships or remotely operated vehicles, are targeted in the most probable areas.

5. Reduced False Alarms: Predictive models can help distinguish between actual mines and false alarms. This reduces the chances of wasting resources on non-threats and improves the effectiveness of mine-clearance operations.

6. Environmental Protection: Sea mines not only pose a threat to vessels but also harm marine ecosystems. Accurate prediction models can minimize the ecological impact by facilitating the removal of mines before they cause environmental damage.

7. International Waters: Sea mines can be deployed in international waters, making it crucial for global maritime security. Predictive models contribute to international efforts to safeguard shipping lanes and maritime trade.

8. Research and Development: Developing prediction models for sonar data encourages innovation in the fields of acoustics, signal processing, and machine learning. This research can lead to more advanced technologies for underwater surveillance and mine detection.

Workflow
Sonar Data -> Data pre-processing -> Train-Test Split -> Logistic Regression Model -> Trained Logistic Regression Model

Firstly, we will take our initial sonar data for processing. Afterwards, split it 9:1 for training and testing respectively.

Then, we will feed it to a logistic regression model because it is a really good choice for binary classfication problems.

The Binary Classfication being: Rock (R) or Mine (M)

I.e. the scan input the sonar model is receiveing is of a rock or a mine.
